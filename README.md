# Lap Lane Illuminator
Source behind my handmade Arduino powered and application controlled lightboard that displays currently open swim lanes at my local pool.

# Background
As a front desk employee at my local aquatic center, it was one of my duties to inform guests of the current layout of our pools before entry.  We were given schedules early in the day that informed us, the front desk staff, of the layout of the pool for the day.  This system was fine, but many times throughout the day, guests had to return to the front and get in line just to ask what was open for the public.  Knowing that many of the guests had limited time in the facility due to work, family, or really anything else, I wanted to streamline our schedule communication for everyone.  I handbuild an Arduino powered LED lightboard that would automatically update the openings of the pool in realtime by lighting and unlighting the LEDS that correspond to the specific lane in the pool on the board.  The data for the Arduino was entered in an application I developed that took in whether the pool was open or closed at specific times throughout the day.
