# Lap-Lane-Availability
This is a project I worked on to solve an issue that I would consistently encounter when working admissions at my local public swimming pool.  
As an employee, we were given weekly schedules that depicted how the pool would be structure on a day-to-day basis.  One problem with this is that these were only available for us in the office, so numerous times throughout the day I would have visitors ask what parts of the pool were open and it hindered the flow of swimmers into the facility.
I figured a solution would be a way to broadcast the information we were given to the visitors by creating an arduino powered light board that depicted the open parts of the pool with a simple array of lit and unlit LEDs representing the open and closed parts respectively.
